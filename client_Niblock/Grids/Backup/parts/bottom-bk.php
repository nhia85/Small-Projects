                    *$0 down attorney fees apply to only those clients that qualify and file a chapter 13 under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and who: 1) have not had chapter 13 
                    dismissed within the past year, and 2) are not trying to stop a foreclosure within 10 days of filing bankruptcy, unless agreed to by attorney. Before filing 
                    the petition with the court, a credit counseling course must be obtained and After filing the petition a debtor education course obtained, both through a third-party 
                    agency and those costs must be paid in addition to the court’s filing fee.  A client who intends to file chapter 7 with our law firm can retain us with as little as $0. 
                    However, our firm will not file a chapter 7 case until the filing fee and all costs are paid in full and all, or a portion approved by attorney, of the attorney’s fees 
                    are paid. A client cannot be offered protection under bankruptcy until the client’s case is filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
